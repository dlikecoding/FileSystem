These men fought so hard. It really broke my heart that they never received any reverence or compensation after everything they did. They were treated like nothing when they should have been respected and honored for for their patriotism and bravery.  I think people of color should join the military because they are a part of this country. This is their country and this is their home so they have an obligation to defend it.  The government should work on addressing issues of racial inequality. People of color should be given equal opportunities to become officers and leaders not just serving on the front line jobs. The U.S military should take steps to build a culture that value diversity and inclusion so everyone can reach their full potentials.
