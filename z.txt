A team is a group of people who work together to achieve a common goal. 
Each member brings their own skills, ideas, and strengths to the group. 
Good communication and trust are key to making the team work well. 
Teams can be small or large, and they often need to collaborate, 
solve problems, and support each other to succeed. 
Working as a team can make tasks easier and help achieve better results 
than working alone.
